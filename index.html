                  <p>At REKKI I focused on trying to significantly lower our CAC by getting the buyer-supplier flywheel spinning and monetising the product. We ran a high number of experiements exploring the flywheel (e.g. building webshops for suppliers to onboard new buyers or creating automated tender processes to get new suppliers). We knew we had to deliver deep value to restaurants and/or suppliers in order to monetise, as the industry is so margin-tight and the people so time-poor. In order to go deep, I spent a lot of time in kitchens. We even spent a quarter working on going through the accounts and trying to drop the food spend of 3 restaurants by 10%  <p>
